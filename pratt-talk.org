** What is DPLA?
  - The Digital Public Library of America
    - A national digital collections project
    - Aggregates metadata from digital collections which they present in their portal at [[http://dp.la][http://dp.la]]

** The Hub model
   - Hubs supply DPLA with metadata
     - 2 types of hub
       - Content hubs
         - large digital collections that provide metadata for their own content, such as NYPL or BHL
       - Service hubs
         - Hubs that harvest, normalize, and aggregate metadata for other institutions
         - They then provide that aggregated metadata to DPLA

** What is ESDN?
  - Empire State Digital Network
    - NY state service hub
    - formed in 2013
  - ESDN coordinates metadata harvest, transformation, and ingest for NY state
  - ESDN provides services to state regional councils whose members want to provide their metadata to
    DPLA
  - Currently funded by and based at METRO

*** Second generation hub
   - Most of the first generation of DPLA hubs were existing digital collections websites that provided OAI feeds from their content management systems
     - Biodiversity Heritage Library, NYPL, Digital Commonwealth (BPL)
   - ESDN part of a "second wave" of hubs

*** The "Second Wave"
   - Pure aggregators
     - we don't host any content ourselves
     - we have no public interfaces (though we're working on it)
   - Currently we harvest partner metadata and transform it into a DPLA-approved format which they then harvest

** What is our workflow?
** Prep - Harvest - Transform - Ingest
*** Prep
   - Regional council members contact their ESDN liaison
   - The member provides a letter granting permission to use their metadata
   - The provider's contact person gets in touch with Karen Hwang, ESDN's Digital Projects Librarian and Metadata Specialist
   - Karen works with the provider to normalize and standardize their data
   - Their metadata is normalized to ESDN's Metadata Application Profile (MAP)

*** Harvest
   - We then ingest their data into REPOX
     - Using various methods and protocols
       - But mostly and ultimately via OAI-PMH
       - There are a few others such as MoMA (The Museum of Modern Art)
       - Their software does not offer OAI-PMH feeds
       - They maintain a Github repository with their collection metadata in various formats
       - We import the CSV format file into a private Omeka installation
       - We then import their records into REPOX via OAI-PMH from Omeka

*** Transform
   - Their data is mapped to the ESDN Metadata Application Profile (MAP)
     - a variant of MODS
     - which is itself mapped to the DPLA MAP
     - We then run their data through XSLT stylesheets which convert it to ESDN MODS
       - it's an iterative process
         - often there will be multiple rounds of writing and rewriting the transforms
       - it's a very manual process
         - tweaking the output

*** Ingest
    - Once the data is reasonably clean it is ingested by DPLA
    - They perform additional transformations and enrichments
    - The resulting data set is then QA'd
      - Once in a while we need to go back and make additional adjustments
    - The records then finally go live on DPLA

** Issues
*** what are we trying to achieve?
    - We try to strike a balance between asking the provider to normalize data and "writing around" the problems in our transformations 
    - Problems are mostly dependent on how consistently the data has been entered into the CMS
      - minor inconsistencies can be written around
      - major inconsistencies require the provider to go back and edit the data

*** For example, the date field can vary widely
    + We've gotten Roman numerals: MCMXVIII
    + Dates written in "natural language" style: June 16, 1904
    + CONTENTdm timespans are formatted oddly: ~1932;1933;1934;1935;1936~ represents the span 1932-1936
    + People will put anything and their dog in the date field 

** What is REPOX?
*** OAI aggregator software
**** Past
    - originally written for the Europeana project
    - appeared to have been abandoned in 2014
      - as such, documentation is spotty
    - used by a number of more recent DPLA hubs
    - Europeana has restarted development work
**** Present
    - DPLA hub user community
      -  DPLA runs a repox-users mailing list
    - The software has a number of undocumented quirks
      - The "records per page" quirk
    - The user community has worked to accumulate a body of support
      - everyone uses it by necessity
      - its relative limbo makes it less than ideal
**** Future
    - the long-needed "Repox replacement"
      - DPLA's aggregator software is in flux given personnel changes
      - DPLA had been working for nearly 3 years on a new aggregator and harvest system
      - Hubs are being moved off the new software back onto their original software
      - While they work on the new new software, release date TBD

** How does REPOX work?
*** Overview
   - We harvest partner feeds in various formats and protocols
   - We are liberal in what we accept and conservative in what we provide
     - Our outgoing format is always ESDN MAP MODS
   - we define "data sets" that specify the incoming format depending on the CMS in use
   - we then write XSL stylesheets that transform the harvested data to ESDN MAP MODS
   - we attach those stylesheets to the data set
   - when DPLA ingests data they harvest the entire repository in ESDN MAP format

*** XSLT
   - we built on the great work done at NCDHC
   - we forked their Github repository of XSLT style-sheets for use with Repox
   - NCDHC mainly works with CONTENTdm providers
   - As the number of different CMSes we saw grew, we developed a CSS-like cascading model for stylesheets
   - our repository is on Github at [[http://github.com/esdnhub/dpla-custom-repox-xslt][http://github.com/esdnhub/dpla-custom-repox-xslt]]

** Lessons
*** Metadata Improvements
   - DPLA as a national project is actually improving metadata at the state and local levels
     - It provides an impetus for institutions to "groom" their metadata
     - it provides justification to administrators to allocate staff time to this work
   - it has led to the formation of the [[http://empirestate.digital/governance/metadata-working-group/][ESDN metadata group]] ([[http://empirestate.digital/governance/metadata-working-group/][http://empirestate.digital/governance/metadata-working-group/]]
     - creating best practices for creating shareable metadata.

** Local history, global data
*** Data re-use
    - ESDN has no public front-end
    - The scope of our available data is constrained by what the DPLA MAP requires
      - REPOX cannot link to external resources
        - XSLT has no facility for connection to networked resources
        - Thus, no linked data
    - Our partners need reporting and statistical tools on their collections in DPLA
    - To address this issue we attempted to build a basic tool

*** The "collstool"
    - Built using Jekyll, a Ruby templating system for producing simple static websites
    - uses ESDN MAP MODS data harvested from our REPOX instance
      - Complicated procession
      - XML -> JSON -> YAML using XSLT and json2yaml
      - Jekyll reads resulting YAML file
    - ungainly, manual process that output inaccurate results
      - Running on Github Pages at [[http://esdnhub.github.io/collstool/][http://esdnhub.github.io/collstool/]]
      - source available at [[http://github.com/ESDNHub/collstool][http://github.com/ESDNHub/collstool]]

*** DPLA Exhibitions
    - Available at [[http://dp.la/exhibitions][http://dp.la/exhibitions]]
    - Built on Omeka ([[http://omeka.org][http://omeka.org]])
    - ESDN is working on exhibitions on Women's Suffrage and for the Erie Canal Anniversary
      - Possibly hosted by ESDN
      - Possibly hosted by DPLA

***  The ESDN portal
    - Plans to work on a NY state wide search portal
    - sort of a "tiny DPLA" for NY state
    - Blacklight Rails application
      - Based on Ben Armintor's "DBLA" gem [[https://github.com/barmintor/dbla][https://github.com/barmintor/dbla]]
    - makes Blacklight think it's talking to a solr repository
      - when it's actually talking to the DPLA API
    - Available at http://esdn.metro.org

*** Future development
    - Harvest and persist records
      - limitations of DPLA API
      - cannot enrich records otherwise
    - extended to integrate additional "external vocabularies"
      - i.e. Linked Open Data
      - Sub-collection info
      - Council info
      - Build additional reporting and search capabilities

*** Rethinking the metadata portal
      - First version only included ESDN records
        - Expanded to include NYPL
      - All things New York, not necessarily constrained by institutions in NY State
